# IoT Clap-Activated Home Automation Project 👏💡

## Overview 🌐

This project implements a **clap-activated home automation system** using an **Arduino Uno**, **ultrasonic sensor**, and **relay**. The system turns a **light bulb** on with two claps and off with another set of two claps. Perfect for making your home smarter with just the sound of your hands! 🤖✨

## Code Structure 📝

The **C++ code** for this project (found in `clap_automation.ino`) is structured as follows:

### Global Variables 🌍

- `sound_sensor`: Pin connected to the ultrasonic sensor (A0). 📡
- `relay`: Pin connected to the relay (13). ⚡
- `clap`: Variable to track the number of claps. 👏
- `detection_range_start` and `detection_range`: Variables to track the time between claps. ⏱️
- `status_lights`: Boolean variable to store the state of the lights. 💡

### Setup ⚙️

Initializes the pins (`sound_sensor` and `relay`) as **INPUT** and **OUTPUT**, respectively. 🔧

### Loop 🔄

- Reads the status of the **ultrasonic sensor**.
- Tracks the number and timing of claps.
- Controls the state of the lights based on the claps.

## Usage ⚡

1. Connect the **ultrasonic sensor** and **relay** according to the provided wiring diagram. 📊
2. Open the `clap_automation.ino` file in the **Arduino IDE**. 💻
3. Upload the code to the **Arduino Uno**. 🚀
4. Power up the system. 🔋
5. Clap twice to turn the light on and clap twice again to turn it off. 👏👋
